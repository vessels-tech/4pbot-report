4Pbot is a chatbot created by Vessels Tech with support from DFS Tech and the Bill & Melinda Foundation.

From August 2017, Vessels Tech has been working on understanding the Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) program in the Philippines, known as Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program - or 4Ps.

4Pbot aims to assist benefeciaries of the 4Ps to better understand the program, and navigate complicated beurocracy and power dynamics, blah blah ... building resilient communities.
