This section provides the context which led us to creating 4PBot. We look into key aspects of Digital Financial Services (DFS) in the Philippines, Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) programs at large, and also the 4P Program. Explaining a bit of background about these things will help you see the how 4PBot was shaped, and where we hope to apply these technologies and approaches in the future.


## Digital Financial Services in the Philippines

The Philippines was actually one of the first countries to develop  technology for digital financial inclusion, having done so in the early 2000’s. Interest and investment into Digital Financial Services has been ongoing since then.

Mobile phones in the Philippines have an 80% penetration rate [^1]. Because of this, the government introduced regulations that have now opened up the opportunity for telcos to compete with banks to deliver mobile money services through a dedicated subsidiary [^2].

The Filipino Central Bank - Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas - invites the regulation, as it sees a vibrant mobile money market as an important starting point, as it provides a service that is directly relevant to Filipinos. Most notably, it believes it to be a good entry point for introducing people to other banking services such as savings in banks, and eventually credit [^3].

Overall, Filipino policy makers and regulators recognise the importance of financial inclusion in the international context, and thus are realising that it is a key development opportunity for the country.

More specifically, the Philippines has been described as a 'mobile money innovation hub' (https://www.gsma.com/mobilefordevelopment/programme/mobile-money/mobile-money-philippines-market-conditions-drive-innovation-smart-money-gcash-philippines-becoming-mobile-money-innovation-hub. The Philippines has unique geographical and demographic conditions; namely, trying to get financial services to its 7,500 islands where only 50% of the islands have bank branches. This has urged stakeholders to come up with creative solutions for improving financial inclusion. As the Philippines has a high mobile penetration rate, mobile operators seem to be spearheading this movement.

However, the mobile money movement does have its share of limitations. Although financial inclusion is meant to benefit the poor, ensuring that they also feel the benefits of mobile money services remains a challenge. This is largely due to accessibility and digital literacy issues (http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTINFORMATIONANDCOMMUNICATIONANDTECHNOLOGIES/Resources/IC4D-2012-Chapter-4.pdf_)(We actually saw a lot of this first-hand when meeting with 4PBot users).  

Furthermore, despite the country’s focus on financial inclusion, only two out of ten households in the Philippines has a savings account. Scholarship is urging policymakers to remember that creating a mobile infrastraucture is only the first step; people, epsecially the poor, will benefit more from additional tailored products and services that encourage better management of finances.


| **Key Factors to keep in consideration:**|   				   |
| ---------------------------------- |-------------------------|
| Cash-based economy:   		     | Filipinos have apprehensions with new technologies; also digital literacy issues.  |
| Community Oriented				 | Filipinos are very community-oriented, and therefore like having, and find comfort in human interaction when it comes to their financial services. [^4]|
| Mobile Technology | Feature phones are still prevalent as compared to smartphones.
| 									 | Limitations with current mobile coverage, and mobile networks reluctance to expand.     |


## Conditional Cash Transfer Programs (CCTs)

CCTs have become one of the most prevalent social assistance programs in low to middle-income countries today. These are programs where the state grants money to recipients, and in returns, the recipients must meet certain conditions. In the case of the 4Ps program, we will see that recipients must meet certain healthcare and educational conditions for their children. It is generally accepted that CCTs are associated with better outcomes in child health and development.


| **CCT Challenges:**|   				   |
| -------------------|-------------|
| _Impact Assessment_ | A particular area that seems to be lacking within CCT development is the matter of effective long-term evaluations of impact [^5]. The scholarship around this mainly discusses appropriate methodology for assessing the claim that CCT’s will reduce poverty levels and increase human capital in the long run as it promises. |
| _Fraud Assessment_ | A less prominent issue in CCT, but worth consideration nonetheless, is control and accountability, and mitigating opportunity for fraud within CCT programs. Social programs are inherently complex, which unfortunately, allow for vulnerabilities in the system.

In the case of the Philippines, these fraud assessments take the form of spot checks at a municipal level. DSWD also runs its own internal review.

_TODO: I think there were some reports about this from the world bank somewhere..._|
| _3rd Party Program Evaluations_ | Government programs are notorious for being underfunded and overworked. Although the DSWD is known for their generous budget, Vessels believe that their work could be complemented and aided through the work of Third Party Evaluations. Outsourcing evaluation to a third party, especially to a company like Vessels, would benefit governments, and other agencies that require data surrounding CCT’s.

In the case of a political history and climate like the Philippines, there sometimes is a real need for trusted third parties to be collecting data. Filipinos are inherently sceptical about their government and associated agencies. How can we ensure that data collected by government agencies will be accurate? And not even because of real corruption, but because of a public perception? A Third Party may be useful in diffusing public bias in order to obtain accurate data.


_TODO: We should mention things about accountability between Govt. and world bank/adb instead here_
_Note: Have tried. Not too sure if it's what you are after._
_kinda. I think we need to understand a little more about the current accountability process first._

## The Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program (4Ps)

The 4P’s program is the third-biggest CCT in the world, behind Brazil and Mexico. It is a national government initiative with the purpose of improving health, education and nutrition in households with children 0-18 years old. This purpose echoes the social initiatives of the government, guided by the Philippines’ objective to participate in outworking the UN Millenium Development Goals.

The Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) govern the program. The funding comes from the national budget, but also through grants from the World Bank and Asia Development Bank (ADB). In 2010, the ADB approved a grant of P19B, along with a further P130M for technical projects [^6]. _TODO: provide conversions to USD and a date_ Another P19B grant was approved in 2016, along with a further P5.2M for technical projects [^7]. The World Bank approved P21B in 2016 for the program [^8]. All grants are set to fund the 4P’s until 2019.


### How it works

The 4P’s operates in all 17 regions of the Philippines. Beneficiaries are currently selected through the National Household Targeting System for Poverty Reduction, which identifies who and where the poor are in the country.


|**Grants**|**Conditions**|
| -------------------|----|
| - Health: P500 per month per household | - Pregnant women must go to pre-natal and post-natal care and be attended by a health professional at childbirth|
| - Education: P300 per child every ten months (households can register a maximum of 3 children).| - Parents/guardians must attend monthly family development seminars, which address topics such as responsible parenting, health and nutrition. |
|- Rice subsidy: P600 a month for buying rice | - Children 0-5yo must receive regular check-ups and vaccines|
| | - Children ages 16-14yo must receive deworming pills twice a year |
| |- Children-beneficiaries of the education grant between ages 3-18 must be enrolled in a school, and must be able to prove 85% attendance. |


Another program, the Modified Conditional Cash Transfer Program, is a complementary program to the 4P’s, and is targeted at the Philippines most poor; families in need of special protection. This includes street-families, families with members that have a disability, victims of child labor and trafficking and so on.
