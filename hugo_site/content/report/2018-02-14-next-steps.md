## Partnership with DSWD

In order to see 4Pbot to reach full potential, we would need to see a partnership, realise a partnership with DSWD or another Government organisation, as 4Pbot can only do so much by itself. The following are benefits if such a partnership were realised: 
- Information about former payout dates
- Promotion for 4Pbot
- Integration with existing processes**** delivering insights through the top dogs, as well as, with permission, sharing our users information to help them solve individual problems--integrating with the current grievance system.
- Building a community that is empowered to encourage and support one another in navigating the system. 
- 4Pbot is the DSWD Form


## Thinking beyond 4ps
- not going to last forever
- where is the Philippines going? How can we meet them there

## Business Plan

- Define whether vessels take grass roots approach or is made for top dogs, such as the World bank or Asian Development Bank. 
- Vessels can use 4Pbot to help with long-term assessment of CCTâ€™s - Able to engage with the recipients and collect data on a regular basis. 
- Selling data
