_TODO: Short section summary_

## What did we learn from the process?

### Facebook was a good approach for an initial prototype

- However, in order to scale, Vessels is of the opinion it must start looking at other methods.
- One clear example would be to use IVR as this would work better for those without smartphones, or who struggle to see/read
	- Interactions with chatbots is not a norm. There is a lack of automated services in the Philippines, in general.
	- To illustrate this, 50% of users did not realise 4Pbot was a chatbot, but in fact, an actual person.

### Hiring a local contractor greatly benefited the project

- Because the contractor was able to speak multiple dialects, we were able to translate surveys and answers in people’s natural language, producing more honest results.
- Even though many Filipinos speak English, having a local person present meant people could talk more freely, and were more comfortable to meet with Vessels.

### Partnership with DSWD

In order to see 4Pbot reach full potential, we would need to realise a partnership with DSWD or another Government organisation, as 4Pbot can only do so much by itself. Benefits that may come from a good partnership include:
- Reliable Information (i.e. former payout dates)
- Wider Promotion of 4PBot
- Integrating with existing processes
	- Opportunity to improve the current reporting system through:
		- Delivering insights to higher ranking organisations in order to potentially solve or monitor systemic issues; and/or
		- Sharing users information, with permission, to help solve individual grievances.


### Other partnerships in the Philippines
- Vessels is still of the belief it should seek future partnerships, and so it was appropriate to meet with different stakeholders.
- However, we acknowledge that it may have been too early in the project to do so.
- Many organisations weren’t ready to partner with us until we had proven some results.
- Majority were interested in the concept.


### Connections
- Starting with better connections would have made the project easier, but could not really be helped in the case.
- That is why hiring a local contractor was invaluable; for their local knowledge, but also, natural network.


## What did we learn from 4Pbot?

_TODO: analyse results from 4pbot and stuff_

## Feedback from our users

The following information has been collected from 4Pbot users, through 4Pbot and face-to-face interaction.

### Digital Literacy Issues
- Some users did not use 4Pbot themselves, but instead, rely on their children to operate the bot, as they  were uncomfortable at operating their smartphones
- Users sometimes appeared reluctant and even embarrassed to demonstrate their interaction with the bot, admitting that they did not really know how to use it as their children would do it for them.
- Some do not own smartphones to begin with


### General Literacy Issues
- Some users had general literacy issues, despite the high literacy rate of the Philippines.
- Literacy issues could also be attributed, or exacerbated by, poor eyesight, but users we interacted with had nothing to alleviate this problem, and so, found 4Pbot inconvenient to operate.
	- It does not appear to be reasonable to expect these users to be able to change the font settings on their smartphones to make their user experience easier, as overall digital literacy is poor.

### Other Important Findings
- Despite some user interface issues, users still find 4Pbot useful.
- Meeting with these users face to face was invaluable for 4Pbot.
- In response to the digital literacy problem, it may be an idea to look into having a ‘callbot’ option. We asked some users their thoughts on this idea, and around half said they would prefer talking to something than reading from messenger.
- Many users were agreed that the most important functions 4Pbot offers is the Payment Date Estimation and the chance to report problems.


### General 4Ps Feedback
- In regards to problem reporting, we asked users why they could not do this with the 4P managers in their district.
- It appears that there is a feeling of distrust towards the government, and a fear that if they were to complain, their payment would be delayed, and even taken away.
	- We asked if they knew of such consequences actually happening, and two or so replied yes.



## Conclusion

Vessels wishes to ensure that 4Pbot is as useful, convenient and relevant as it can be for its users. The above research presents interesting issues that deserve further thought and problem-solving.

For example, in order to provide the wanted service of Problem Reporting, how do we maintain 4Pbot’s independence from government agencies so that it can be a genuine troubleshooter for users, in order to retrieve accurate and honest data? Will this lead to any tensions between 4Pbot and the 4Ps program and administrators? If so, how do we navigate such tensions? Ultimately, we would want to be able to enhance this government program: we do not want to be working against it, even if 4Pbot turns out to have more of a watchdog function. We need to consider how to make sure the recipients of the 4Ps still receive benefits even if we run into tensions.

Further, in relation to providing Payment Date Estimates, the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) in the Philippines, does not appear to have any records of Payment Dates at this time. This means that Vessels does not yet have any real reliable data to make Payment Date Estimations. A solution to this, however, is to collect the data ourselves.
