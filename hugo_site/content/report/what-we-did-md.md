_TODO: short section summary_

## First Research Phase

We began our first phase of research by, concentrating on the Philippines’ 4Ps program _todo: isn't this the entire of what we focused on?_. In this phase, we also researched financial services and financial literacy, in both general terms and their relevance and use in the Philippines.

In order to aid our research, Vessels employed a hired contractor, who was a Filipina, living in Cebu, Philippines. This contractor spoke two of the major dialects in the Philippines (Tagalog and Cebuano), and had connections to families a part of the 4Ps program.

Through this contractor, we were able to distribute 100 surveys across Cebu and Mindanao. None were distributed to Luzon at this time, as most of our contractor’s connections were in middle and southern islands of the Philippines. Later, Vessels was able to conduct online surveys via Facebook, as there appeared to be Facebook groups and communities, dedicated to 4P beneficiaries. In this way, we were able to reach an audience that spanned the entirety of the Philippines, but of course, was still limited in that it only pertained to active Facebook users.

Vessels also corresponded with other botmakers, most notably, Matt Wallace in Myanmar. Wallace has developed a chatbot for the organisation, _Opportunities NOW Myanmar_ [^9]. They use chatbot technology to train people who partake in their microfinance services. Even though the Opportunities NOW chatbot has more of an education application, Vessels was still able to glean valuable lessons in relation to the implementation of the chatbot.

## First Philippines Visit

Vessels embarked on its first Philippines visit in order to meet 4P beneficiaries face to face. At these meetings, the conversations were centered around problems with the welfare program, people’s daily experiences in relation to their finances, and their interaction and/or understanding with formal financial institutions.

Another group of people that Vessels met with were stakeholders, in both the Filipino Government and of other social enterprises. The purpose of these meetings was to discuss potential partnerships, and to talk and brainstorm around the application of chatbot technology for other services.


## Implementation

Vessels designed and developed 4Pbot 0.1. This was released to a small set of private testers; 10-15 people.

Their feedback was then incorporated into the product. 4Pbot was then launched to the public and promoted amongst 4P Facebook Groups.

We then iterated 4Pbot 0.3. With this version, conversation flow issues had been addressed and the Payment Date Estimation feature had been removed, because it was not accurate enough.


## Second Philippines Visit

Vessels came back to the Philippines, to Toledo City,  and met face-to-face with a small subset of 4Pbot users; 6 middle-aged women. In our conversations, we asked them about their experience with 4Pbot and the 4Ps program. We also simply watched and took record of how the women used the bot.

We also took the opportunity to travel to Bantayan Island to visit a small village project. We did this with the next iteration of this project in mind. On Bantayan, we interviewed people, with the focus of discovering more about people’s financial situations. In doing so, Vessels was able to gain key insights into the different financial services and financial literacy amongst ordinary Filipino people.
