## Digital Financial Services in the Philippines

The Philippines was actually one of the first countries to develop  technology for digital financial inclusion, having done so in the early 2000’s. Interest and investment into Digital Financial Services has been ongoing since then. _TODO: need to mention mobile money and its limitations explicitly_

Despite the country’s focus on financial inclusion, only two out of ten households in the Philippines has a savings account. However, mobile phones have an 80% penetration rate [^1]. Because of this, the Philippines introduced regulations that have now opened up the opportunity for telcos to compete with banks to deliver mobile money services through a dedicated subsidiary [^2].

The Filipino Central Bank - Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas - invites the regulation, as it sees a vibrant mobile money market as an important starting point, as it provides a service that is directly relevant to Filipinos. Most notable, it believes it to be a good entry point for introducing people to other banking services, such as savings in banks, and eventually credit [^3].

Overall, Filipino policy makers and regulators recognise the importance of financial inclusion in the international context, and thus are realising that it is a key development opportunity for the country. 

| **Key Factors to keep in consideration:**|   				   |
| ---------------------------------- |-------------------------|
| Cash-based economy:   		     | Filipinos have apprehensions with new technologies; also digital literacy issues.  |
| Community Oriented				 | Filipinos are very community-oriented, and therefore like having, and find comfort in human interaction when it comes to their financial services. [^4]|
| Mobile Technology | Feature phones are still prevalent as compared to smartphones.
| 									 | Limitations with current mobile coverage, and mobile networks reluctance to expand.     |


## Conditional Cash Transfer Programs (CCTs)

CCTs have become one of the most prevalent social assistance programs in low to middle-income countries today. These are programs where the state grants money to recipients, and in returns, the recipients must meet certain conditions. In the case of the 4Ps program, we will see that recipients must meet certain healthcare and educational conditions for their children. It is generally accepted that CCTs are associated with better outcomes in child health and development.
