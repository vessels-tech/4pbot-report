## Digital Financial Services in the Philippines

The Philippines was actually one of the first countries to develop  technology for digital financial inclusion, having done so in the early 2000’s. Interest and investment into Digital Financial Services has been ongoing since then. 

Despite the country’s focus on financial inclusion, only two out of ten households in the Philippines has a savings account. However, mobile phones have an 80% penetration rate[^1]. Because of this, the Philippines introduced regulations that have now opened up the opportunity for telcos to compete with banks to deliver mobile money services through a dedicated subsidiary.
