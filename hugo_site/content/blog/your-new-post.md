## IMPLEMENTATION

Vessels designed and developed 4Pbot 0.1. This was released to a small set of private testers; 10-15 people.

Their feedback was then incorporated into the product. 4Pbot was then launched to the public and promoted amongst 4P Facebook Groups.

We then iterated 4Pbot 0.3. With this version, conversation flow issues had been addressed and the Payment Date Estimation feature had been removed, because it was not accurate enough.

## SECOND PHILIPPINES VISIT

Vessels came back to the Philippines, to Toledo City,  and met face-to-face with a small subset of 4Pbot users; 6 middle-aged women. In our conversations, we asked them about their experience with 4Pbot and the 4Ps program. We also simply watched and took record of how the women used the bot.

We also took the opportunity to travel to Bantayan Island to visit a small village project. We did this with the next iteration of this project in mind. On Bantayan, we interviewed people, with the focus of discovering more about peopleâ€™s financial situations. In doing so, Vessels was able to gain key insights into the different financial services and financial literacy amongst ordinary Filipino people.
