      <description>IMPLEMENTATION Vessels designed and developed 4Pbot 0.1. This was released to a small set of private testers; 10-15 people.
Their feedback was then incorporated into the product. 4Pbot was then launched to the public and promoted amongst 4P Facebook Groups.
We then iterated 4Pbot 0.3. With this version, conversation flow issues had been addressed and the Payment Date Estimation feature had been removed, because it was not accurate enough.</description>
