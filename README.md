#4Pbot Report

This is the report site summarizing our findings with 4pbot.

I thought it would be good to actually have a small, dedicated site for doing this, instead of a PDF or list of blog posts. So here it is.


## Themes

this might do just fine:
https://themes.gohugo.io/kube/


## Publishing:

https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/

Not sure where we'll host just yet - maybe just on Firebase also?
